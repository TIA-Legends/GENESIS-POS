Welcome to our Python Tkinter Point of Sale (POS) System project! This project aims to develop a comprehensive POS system using Python programming language and Tkinter framework for the graphical user interface (GUI). In addition to Tkinter, we're utilizing Tkinter Designer for efficient UI design and Figma for collaborative design prototyping. This POS system will offer a user-friendly interface for both cashiers and administrators, facilitating tasks such as product registration, inventory management, sales reporting, and payment processing. With a focus on usability, scalability, and reliability, our project aims to provide a robust solution for businesses in need of a versatile POS system
